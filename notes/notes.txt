1. The first step is to create MapMaker class
2. The second step is to create the Monster classes
3. The third step is to create the Player class
4. Test all the steps with each other
  a. Started this step before step 3, so I am going to suspend progress on testing for
     now
5. Write a story
6. Add classes needed to complement the story
7. Create a map using MapMaker to follow the journey of the story
8. Program the interactions that the story will create



Update: Will try and use a more complex datastructure for map as the array is a bit simple, and 
really I want something more like a has where things can be accessed by a key rather than looping through
and finding it. Or a linked list, which would be very interesting.

Update: Need to use YARD to document my files lol, takes too long to just look at the methods and figure out what
        parameters they need. Lots of scrolling and things involved. Learn the usage of metadata tags and 
        use the ability to generate documentation well.

Update: Need some kind of system where there are certain states that a "character can be in" so I should definitely wrap
        the monster and player classes in a large module that will effectively give them capabilities that are in that module.
        This is so there can be buffs and debuffs that are applied to both player characters and monsters.
